Vocalcoin
---

A token for political engagement.

### Concept

Turning voting and political involvement into a tradeable digital asset.

You give a vote, in return you can use those votes to promote your own causes on the Vocalcoin network.

Going after the following challenges:
* Main prizes
* Social Good Challenge - Sponsored by The Chopra Foundation
* Tokenization Protocol Challenge - Sponsored by University College London.

Built on Hedera using HTS which reduced the complexity in deploying the Vocalcoin contract without requiring deploying a smart contract manually.

## Dev notes

`/server`: Vocalcoin app server code. Run using testnet - `yarn; yarn start`
`/server/vocalcoin.js`: Generates the Vocalcoin token on the Hedera network using the Hedera Token Service (HTS).
`/web`: Vocalcoin client website. Run using testnet backend - `yarn; yarn start`
